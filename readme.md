# Paul's Portfolio
## HW Assignment 1

This is my first professional website portfolio. I made it so I can show employers my skills and capaibilites. Although there is not much material on it now, I will continuously add to it throughout the bootcamp. 

# Layout 

* About Me Page
    * A quick bio about me

* Portfolio
    * A page where I will display all of my future porjects

* Contact Page  
    * A form that allows people to contact me

# My Thought Process

My thought process for this portfolio was very simple. Because we only got to use html and css, I felt limited to the things I could do. I had some visions for my page however, it would have been inefficient to code using only html and css. Therefore, I decided to get the skeleton of my page down now, and add to it as the course moves along. My hope is that by the end of the bootcamp, I will have implemented everything I learned to make a great portfolio website that showcases all of my skills to employers. 

# What I Learned

I learned that organizing your code is crucial. I got to a point where I had a lot of bugs, and instead of debugging every individual component, I found it easier to just start over. Getting a piece of paper and actually drawing what you envision your website to be, befroe even writing a single line of code was very benficial for me. Besides that, I learned if I have any trouble or questions, just google it, then copy and paste.
